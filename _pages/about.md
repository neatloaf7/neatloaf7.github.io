 Hello, welcome to my site. This is where I will post about my hobby projects and other various things I find interesting.

I was originally using hackaday to document my projects, but it started to turn into sort of a disjointed blog. I will try to keep my hackaday page for finished projects, and keep my logs and random insights on here.

My projects are often focused around 3d printing and using microcontrollers to create PC perhipherals and other little gadgets. I am a mechanical engineer without much experience in programming, so beware when trying to parse through my code.
